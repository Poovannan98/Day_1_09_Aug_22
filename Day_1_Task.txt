Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
